2025-03-06T15:50:44.684247,assistant,"Biomimicry is an approach to innovation that seeks sustainable solutions to human challenges by emulating nature's time-tested patterns and strategies. The term was coined by Janine Benyus in her book ""Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature"". It involves studying nature's models and then imitating or taking inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems sustainably.

For example, the design of solar panels is inspired by the photosynthetic process of plants. Similarly, the development of self-cleaning materials is inspired by the water repellent properties of lotus leaves. 

Biomimicry aims not only at sustainability but also efficiency and effectiveness in solving complex human problems. It provides a new way to look at the world and find solutions that work with nature rather than against it.",1.2169,8328.49,124
