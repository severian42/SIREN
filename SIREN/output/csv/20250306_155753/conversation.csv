2025-03-06T15:58:20.351091,assistant,"Biomimicry is an innovative design approach that uses nature as a model for sustainable innovation in technology, product development, and architecture. It's based on the idea that nature holds all the answers to our problems â€“ we just have to look closely at how natural systems work and imitate those processes.

In other words, biomimicry involves studying biological entities such as plants, animals or even microorganisms for inspiration in solving complex human problems. The goal is to emulate the forms, processes and ecosystems of nature for the purpose of sustainability, efficiency and resilience in design and innovation. 

For example, biomimicry has been used in the development of a car that looks like a shark's skin to reduce its drag coefficient, or in creating solar panels inspired by the way leaves capture sunlight. The approach is also being applied in architecture with buildings designed to regulate their own temperature based on the principles of human physiology.

The term 'biomimicry' was coined by Janine Benyus, an American natural sciences writer and sustainability advocate. It's part of a broader movement called ""biological mimicry"" or ""bio-inspired design"".",1.0013,11403.20,183
